# Trappist-1_MM
Hello! You proabably got here from a QR code on one of my posters. The Mega-MUSCLES SEDs will soon be available [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/muscles/), but if you want to get started here is the semi-empirical model of Trappist-1, along with the submitted paper describing the observations and SED production. The model has two versions: "const_res" is binned to 1A, whilst "var_res" keeps whatever resolution the different parts came as. 

If you use these SEDs in a scientific publication, please cite Wilson et al. (2020, submitted) and include a link to the hlsp page. Also, please let me know what you're doing, if you have any questions or feedback about the SED, and/or  if there is anyway I can help with your project: <djwilson394@gmail.com>.
